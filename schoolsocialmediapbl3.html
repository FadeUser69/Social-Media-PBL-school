<p>Social media has undoubtedly brought about numerous positive changes in our lives. However, it also has some negative impacts that cannot be ignored. One of the major negative impacts of social media is the rise of cyberbullying. The anonymity that social media provides has given rise to a new form of bullying that can be extremely damaging to the victims. Moreover, the excessive use of social media has been linked to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, especially in young adults. It has also been found that the use of social media can lead to addiction, which can hurt one's personal and professional life. Therefore, it is important to use social media responsibly and mindfully to avoid these negative impacts. Social media has been associated with making people feel bad about themselves due to various reasons. One of the main reasons is the constant comparison that happens on social media platforms. People tend to compare their lives with the posts they see on social media, which can create feelings of low self-esteem. Moreover, social media platforms are known to promote unrealistic beauty standards, which can make people feel insecure about their appearance. The pressure to present a perfect image on social media can also contribute to feelings of anxiety and self-doubt. In addition, the fear of missing out on social media can make people feel left out and unhappy. All these factors combined make social media a double-edged sword, which can have both positive and negative impacts on our lives.</p>
