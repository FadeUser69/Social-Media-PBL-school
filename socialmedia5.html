<p>Terry, writing the paragraphs and all the information needed to answer questions that required answers</p>
<p>Alex, filming videos and scripiting the point of the videos</p>
<p>Overall everyone tried their 150% on finishing this project and putting a relentless amount of effort into making it our best project in Northcross Intermediate.</p>
